# University-Capstone-Project-Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity and Networking.

Several units provided foundational and hands-on learning of key cybersecurity knowledge, technologies, processes, and methodologies.

Strong focus was also put on risk assessment, threat event identification, vulnerability mitigation, and providing correct and adequate security solutions.

The foundations of Network design, deployment and maintenance were learnt, along with layered physical/logical network security, system administration, and implementation of data/network backup and recovery processes.

For my group Capstone project, we were tasked with designing and implementing a smart hospital network, with a strong focus on cybersecurity. 

I researched and ran risk assessments for the smart hospital network, identifying real threat events, providing security solutions and mitigation strategies, and compiled an extensive cybersecurity manual for all aspects pertaining to the hospital's IT security.

I was also charged with integrating a myriad of IoT devices into the hospital network and Amazon cloud, such as medical IoT and wearable patient devices, including those IoT devices used in outcall patient care and fleet deployment.
